        Lo and behold - the first ever Infinum JavaScript talks! We are starting with a bang! First talk is by Darko, a JavaScript Team lead at Infinum who loves working on the cutting edge of new technologies. As you would expect, his talk is about features that don&#39;t yet exist in the browser. Luka Skukan, on the other hand, is our resident JavaScript overengineer. He&#39;ll be talking about patterns and standards that you probably don&#39;t even need, but  might find useful.

We have cookies (muffins).

        WebCamp Zagreb 2016 conference weekend is a great opportunity for us to host a super-special JavaScript event - a workshop which will explore one of the hottest things in the world of software development, AWS lambda serverless infrastructure.

This workshop will guide you through programming for the cloud. You&#39;ll learn how to create cloud functions to manage virtual tanks. At the end of the day, there will be a tournament where we&#39;ll all engage our virtual tanks in a series of battles, while we&#39;ll grab some pizza&#39;n&#39;beer and watch the show.
