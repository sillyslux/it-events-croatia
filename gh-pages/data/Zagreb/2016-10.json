    "description": "Lo and behold - the first ever Infinum JavaScript talks! We are starting with a bang! First talk is by Darko, a JavaScript Team lead at Infinum who loves working on the cutting edge of new technologies. As you would expect, his talk is about features that don't yet exist in the browser. Luka Skukan, on the other hand, is our resident JavaScript overengineer. He'll be talking about patterns and standards that you probably don't even need, but  might find useful.\r\n\r\nWe have cookies (muffins).",
